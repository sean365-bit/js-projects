## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- Complete the form and see a success toast message upon successful submission
- Receive form validation messages if:
  - A required field has been missed
  - The email address is not formatted correctly
- Complete the form only using their keyboard
- Have inputs, error messages, and the success message announced on their screen reader
- View the optimal layout for the interface depending on their device's screen size
- See hover and focus states for all interactive elements on the page

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

I enjoyed developing this solution for the contact form. I revisited CSS Flexbox and went through the process of validating a form using JavaScript. I also learned about the mobile-first workflow, which prioritizes mobile devices.

```js
const proudOfThisFunc = () => {
  console.log("ðŸŽ‰");
};
```
